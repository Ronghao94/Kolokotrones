# Kolokotrones

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Ronghao94/Kolokotrones/master?urlpath=rstudio)

A longstanding problem in biology is to characterize the scaling
relationship between basal metabolic rate and body mass. In a landmark
paper published in *Nature*, Kolokotrones *et al.* (2010) show that the
relationship takes on a convex curvature on a logarithmic scale. In this
compendium, we provide the data, code, and other R tools to replicate
Figure 1a from this paper.

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

-   [:file\_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figure generated by
    the analysis. It also has a rendered version, `paper.docx`, suitable
    for reading (the code is replaced by figures in this file).
-   [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.
-   [:file\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations.
-   [:file\_folder:templates](/analysis/templates): Templates used to
    build this research compendium.

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from this URL:
[master.zip](https://github.com/Ronghao94/Kolokotrones/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
After unzipping:

-   open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
-   run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this
    analysis depends on (also listed in the [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION)
    file).
-   finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the
    `paper.docx`, or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")`
    in the R console
